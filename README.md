## Testing üß™

To facilitate testing of ComplexCalculatorC, two text files are provided:

- [input.txt](input.txt): Contains a series of valid inputs for testing various functionalities of the program. You can use these inputs to see how the program handles typical use cases.

    <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px">
      <i>Example of valid inputs in <code>input.txt</code></i>
    </div>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="images/correct_input.png" alt="Input example"
      height="500px" width="500px"/>
    </p>

- [invalid_input.txt](invalid_input.txt): Includes examples of invalid inputs to test the program's error handling and robustness. This can help ensure that the program gracefully handles unexpected or incorrect user input.
    <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px">
      <i>Example of invalid inputs in <code>invalid_input.txt</code></i>
    </div>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="images/invalid_input.png" alt="Invalid input example"
      height="500px" width="500px"/>
    </p>

Feel free to use these files to experiment with the program and understand its capabilities and limitations.

## New: Expression Parser and Evaluator üßÆ

This program is a C-based expression parser and evaluator. It constructs an expression tree from mathematical expressions and then evaluates them. Perfect for learning and understanding how parsing works in compilers!

The parser was originaly designed for the leetcode problem [Basic Calculator](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator/), but it can be used as a standalone program or as a library for other projects.

### Features üåü

- **Expression Parsing**: Converts a string representation of a mathematical expression into an expression tree.
- **Unary and Binary Operations**: Handles both unary (e.g., `-5`) and binary (e.g., `5 + 3`) operations.
- **Nested Expressions**: Supports expressions within parentheses (e.g., `(3 + (2 - 1))`).
- **Inline Functions**: Utilizes inline functions for efficient calculation.
- **Readable Tree Output**: Prints the structure of the expression tree for easy visualization.

### How to Compile üõ†Ô∏è

To compile the program, use the same makefile as before:

```bash
make
```

This command compiles the [calc.c](calc.c) file using the C99 standard with level 2 optimizations, which includes function inlining.

### Usage üìñ

Run the compiled program from the command line. You can input mathematical expressions, and the program will parse these expressions, construct an expression tree, and then evaluate them.

Simply execute `./expression_parser` and enter your expression at the prompt. The program will output the evaluated result along with a visual representation of the expression tree.

### Example

The program will parse the expression, construct the tree, and output the result along with the tree structure:

Output of [calc_tests.txt](calc_tests.txt):

  hight = 500px width = 500px/>

## New: Reversed Polish Calculator üßÆ

File [PRN.c](PRN.c) is a C-based reversed polish calculator designed for the leetcode problem [Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/). It evaluates mathematical expressions written in reversed polish notation (RPN) and supports dynamic stack allocation.

This solution is 99% faster and 99% less memory-intensive than other submissions on leetcode, by utilizing dynamic stack allocation combined with function inlining.

```c
/* The structure includes pointer to functions to demonstrate basic OOP concepts */
typedef struct Stack {
    int *arr;
    int sp;
    int max_size;
    int (*pop)(struct Stack *);
    void (*push)(struct Stack *s, int);
} Stack;
```
